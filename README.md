# Stock Prediction Project

This project aims to provide stock predictions using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical stock data, stocks that correlate with target stock, and predict future stock prices by plotting a graph. This will be done with machine learning as well as technical analysis.

## Webscraping
- The project will start by webscraping historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Scrape the correlation matrix of the stocks.
- The correlation matrix will be used to identify stocks that correlate with the target stock.
- Scrape the historical stock prices of the correlated stocks.
- Scrape the historical stock prices of the target stock.
- Scrape the historical stock prices of the correlated stocks.

## Data manipulation
_ The data will be stored in a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
_ The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing values.


## What this project does:
- This project uses machine learning to predict future stock prices.
- It uses technical analysis to identify stocks that correlate with the target stock/use correlating stocks to make a prediction
